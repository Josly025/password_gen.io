# password_gen.io

### Project Description

- The goal of this project was to use javascript to create a random password consisting of uppercase,
  lowercase, and special characters. It should also be adjusted by a prompt for the user to input
  how long they would like the passwrod to be and what attributes it would contain (uppercase, lowercase,
  and special characters). Then, the final password should be made a available to the user through an
  alert message.

### Installation Instruction

N/A

### Usage Instructions

- Follow the each web prompt's exact instructions to generate your
  random password with custom attributes (two prompts)
- Then, use your new password given by an alert confirmation

### Credits/Thanks

- W3schools: I learned about .length, stringlist( ), and reviewed
  various logicla operators

- I also used the code academy's javascript glossary to review loops
  and proper array/variable syntax

### License Information

N/A

### Future Goals

- I would the password available to the user inside of the button/password button
  using the DOM. I did not succeed in this aspect; however, I am still learning to
  add content CSS and HTML elements on the fly with dev tools. I would also like to
  get A LOT more comfortabel with javascript. I would like to learn different
  ways of generating passwords or varying ways to incorporate the customized
  character lengths, cases, and specials characters.
